In my spare time, I like to learn new technologies or experiment with small ideas.  Below are just a few of my ideas, more can be found at my Github.

## Pal

Pal is a tool that simplifies the analysis of any tabular data (think CSV files). At it's core, it is a descriptive template written to extract, manipulate, transform or report on provider billing data.

Cloud billing files are tabular data files that can get really, **really** large. So large in fact, that analysis is Excel is a pretty average experience. Moreover, whilst you can use cloud provider tools, they don't allow the easy composure, templating and sharing of reporting *ideas*. Why shouldn't I be able to design a query and run it against any billing file I like?  By templating out the reporting intelligence, the paradigm of 'write once, run many times' can be applied to your billing files. 

You can find out more about Pal [here](https://github.com/williamthom-as/pal).

## Cure

Cure is a tool that can be used to anonymise, replace, or redact information from tabular data files. It requires a descriptive template file to define the changes needed on each column.

The biggest benefit (and the reason I wrote it), is to anonymise cloud data for the purposes of demonstrating "real" data to customers without leaking private information.
