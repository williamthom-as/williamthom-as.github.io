In my spare time, I like to learn new technologies or experiment with small ideas.  Below are just a few of my ideas, more can be found at my Github.

## Pal

Pal is a tool that simplifies the analysis of the billing files given to you by cloud providers. At it's core, it is a descriptive template written to extract, manipulate, transform or report on provider billing data.

#### Why did I write it?

Cloud billing files can get really, **really** large. So large in fact, that analysis is Excel is a pretty average experience. Moreover, whilst you can use cloud provider tools, they don't allow the easy composure, templating and sharing of reporting *ideas*. Why shouldn't I be able to design a query and run it against any billing file I like?  By templating out the reporting intelligence, the paradigm of 'write once, run many times' can be applied to your billing files.
